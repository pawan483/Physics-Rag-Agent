# 🌌 Physics RAG Agent

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based agent that provides **detailed, structured explanations of physics concepts** using trusted sources like Wikipedia.

This app retrieves relevant physics documents, builds contextual understanding, and generates clear explanations for complex topics such as **string theory, dark energy, time dilation**, and more.

You can try the deployed model here: [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pawanpaluvuri/RagAgenticBot)
